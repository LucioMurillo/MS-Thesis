# MS-Thesis

This repository contains the following information for my Master's thesis "Effects of electron emission from biased electrodes on sheath dynamics under fusion-relevant conditions" (found here: link):

- Scripts for calculating and plotting the ion- and electron-induced electrom emission yield and spectra
- Experimental data for the ion and electron-induced yield and spectra
- Gkeyll input files for simulating plasma sheaths with ion- and electron-induced emission at various bias potentials
- Outputs from Gkeyll for the simulations presented in the thesis document
- Postprocessing scripts to generate plots from .gkyl output files
