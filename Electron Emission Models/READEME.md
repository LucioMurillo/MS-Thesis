Python scripts are provided to generate the energy-dependent, ion- and electron-induced emission yield and spectra for graphite and tungsten. Experimental data is provided under /'Experimental Data' which can be used to generate plots similar to those found in the thesis document. These scripts rely on SRIM output files for electronic and nuclear stopping power of impacting protons. The SRIM outputs for graphite and tungsten are found under /'Electron Emission Models'/IIEE/SRIM/. Note that the 1.78 g/cc file for graphite is used due to the experiment being modeled (Fusion Z-pinch Experiment) uses [pocographite]([url](https://poco.entegris.com/en/home/products/premium-graphite/industrial-grades/axf5q.html)) electrodes.

To install SRIM follow the instruction on their [website]([url](http://www.srim.org/index.htm#HOMETOP)). SRIM can be used to generate ion stopping powers for arbitrary impacting species and wall material. The python scripts can be easily modified to take a new SRIM output and calculate the fitting parameters needed for the gkyl simulations.
