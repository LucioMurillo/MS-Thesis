Python scripts are provided to generate the energy-dependent, ion- and electron-induced emission yield and spectra for graphite and tungsten. Experimental data is provided under /'Experimental Data' which can be used to generate plots similar to those found in the thesis document. These scripts rely on SRIM output files for electronic and nuclear stopping power of impacting protons. The SRIM outputs for graphite and tungsten are found under /'Electron Emission Models'/IIEE/SRIM/. Note that the 1.78 g/cc file for graphite is used due to the experiment being modeled (Fusion Z-pinch Experiment) using pocographite (https://poco.entegris.com/en/home/products/premium-graphite/industrial-grades/axf5q.html) electrodes. For the graphite case one also needs to load the density of states (DOS) data found in /'Electron Emission Models'/IIEE 

To install SRIM follow the instructions on their website (http://www.srim.org/index.htm#HOMETOP). Note that there are some issues using the compound dictionary for local installations (at least on windows). I have found installing on a linux system (WSL on windows) helps fix this, though it can be annoying to use (helpful guide for linux install: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mmg9JlEwSD4). SRIM can be used to generate ion stopping powers for arbitrary impacting species and wall material. The python scripts can be easily modified to take a new SRIM output and calculate the fitting parameters needed for the gkyl simulations. The fitting parameters are for the logarithmic, assymetric Lorentzian (for ion's electronic stopping power) and logarithmic gaussian (for ion's nuclear stopping power). See Ch. 4 in the thesis document for more information on these functions and theor role in the Gkeyll emission boundary condition.
